1. Always do git status
  - find out what branch you are currently on
2. Branching:
  2.1 Create a new branch with "git checkout -b <Branch Name>"
  2.2 Add all changes to branch with "git add ."
  2.3 Commit changes to that branch with "git commit -m "<comments>" "
  2.4 Check git status, ensure tree is clean, then push your new branch to remote origin with
    "git push origin <Your branch name>"
3. Pulling: Always pull from main branch from remote repo
  3.1 Pull via "git pull origin main" (git pull origin <branch name>)

4. Branch Navigation:
  4.1 View all branches with "git branch -v"
  4.2 Change to branch via "git checkout <branch_name>"
  4.3 Delete branch with "git branch -d <branch name>"
  4.4 Rename branch with "git branch -m <branch name>"

5. Remote repository:
  5.1 To add new remote repo, use "git remote add <Name your remote> <URI for the repo>"
  5.2 To modify the URI of an existing remote, use "git remote set-url <name of remote> <new.url/here>"
    - Alternatively, modify it directly in ".git/config"
   5.3 to clone from remote repo to exisiting directory, use "git clone git@github.com:wzhua02/new-folder.git git_commands/"
