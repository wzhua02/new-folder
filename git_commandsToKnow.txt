1. Always do git status
  - find out what branch you are currently on

2. Branching:
  2.1 Create a new branch with "git checkout -b <Branch Name>"
  2.2 Add all changes to branch with "git add ."
  2.3 Commit changes to that branch with "git commit -m "<comments>" "
  2.4 Check git status, ensure tree is clean, then push your new branch to remote origin with
    "git push origin <Your branch name>"

3. Pulling: Always pull from main branch from remote repo
  3.1 Pull via "git pull origin main" (git pull origin <branch name>)

4. Branch Navigation:
  4.1 View all branches with "git branch -v"
  4.2 Change to branch via "git checkout <branch_name>"
  4.3 Delete branch with "git branch -d <branch name>" (use -D to force delete)
  4.4 Rename branch with "git branch -m <branch name>"

5. Remote repository:
  5.1 To add new remote repo, use "git remote add <Name your remote> <URI for the repo>"
  5.2 To modify the URI of an existing remote, use "git remote set-url <name of remote> <new.url/here>"
    - Alternatively, modify it directly in ".git/config"
  5.3 to clone from remote repo to exisiting directory, use "git clone git@github.com:wzhua02/new-folder.git git_commands/"

6. Version Control:
  6.1 Reverting to a previous commit:
  - To revert to a pervious commit, check "git log" for the hash for the target commit, copy the first few characters of the commit hash.
  - Do "git checkout <first few char of commit hash>" to view the target commit, check the code, ensure it is the commit you want.
  - Create a new branch for the target commit by doing "git checkout <name of new branch> <first few char of commit hash>".
